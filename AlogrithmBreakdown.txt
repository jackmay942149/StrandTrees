Step 1:
Create a DAG (T) which is a collection of nodes (N) each with a collection of edges (E)
 - T will be a list of N and E Pairs
 - T[0] will be the root node
 - N will be a id, position
 - E will be a list of N id's 
 - For visualisation a line renderer will be drawn for T[i] where it will have the points (N.pos, E[j]) for each j in E
